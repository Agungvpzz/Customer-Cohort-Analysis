The Online Retail II dataset provides detailed insights into the sales activities of an online store from December 1, 2009, to December 9, 2011. This dataset is available on Kaggle. The company specializes in unique giftware suitable for a variety of occasions. A substantial portion of the customer base consists of wholesalers. 

## 3. Business Goals
Customer cohort analysis enables businesses to segment customers based on shared behaviors and analyze these groups over time, aiming to improve retention by identifying churn patterns and enhancing customer experiences.

## 4. Objectives
1. **Pattern Cohort Behaviour Discovery**: Identify and analyze behavioral patterns of different cohorts over time to understand their purchasing habits, frequency, and value.
2. **Enhancing Retention Rates**: Determine which cohorts exhibit lower retention rates and develop targeted strategies to improve retention for these specific groups.
3. **Discover Seasonal Effect**: Identify key periods during the year when customer sales typically decline or stagnate, indicating a potential need for promotional activities.

## 5. Methodology
- We divided our customer cohort based on the starting quarter of the customers purchased
- We notice the unequal distribution of cohort dates. In the first quarter, there is only 1 month left (2009-Dec)
- We used Python and utilized Python packages, such as Pandas for data analysis and Plotly for data visualization.

## 6. Hypothesis
- Customers who make frequent purchases in the first few months are more likely to become repeat customers.
- Customers with higher initial purchase amounts tend to have higher retention rates.
